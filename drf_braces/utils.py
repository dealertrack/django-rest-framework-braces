    Generic utility for adding a base class to an instance.

    This function returns a copy of the given instance which
    will then include the new base_class in its ``__mro__``.

    The way that is done internally is it creates a brand new
    class with correct bases. Then the newly created class is
    instantiated. Since ``__init__`` could be expensive operation
    in any of the base classes of the original instance mro,
    nto make it cheap, we temporarily switch __init__ with
    super simple implementation which does nothing but only
    instantiates class. Once instantiated, then we copy all of the
    instance attributes to the newly created instance.
    Finally, then we pop our mock ``__init__`` implementation.

    Args:
        instance (object): Instance of any object
        base_class (type): Any class which will be added as first class
            in the newly copied instance mro.
